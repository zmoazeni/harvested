# Harvested: A Ruby Harvest API

This is a Ruby wrapper for the [Harvest API](http://www.getharvest.com/api).

## Installation

    gem install harvested

## Examples

```ruby
harvest = Harvest.client('yoursubdomain', 'yourusername', 'yourpassword')
harvest.projects() # list out projects

client = Harvest::Client.new(:name => "Billable Company LTD.")
client = harvest.clients.create(client)
harvest.clients.find(client.id) # returns a Harvest::Client
```

You can also pass query options in as the last parameter on any objects `all` finder
method, for example to find all the projects for client ID 12345:

```ruby
harvest = Harvest.client('yoursubdomain', 'yourusername', 'yourpassword')
harvest.projects.harvest.projects.all(nil, :client => 12345)
```

Note, the second parameter is a User ID field that is optional, but needs to be specified
as nil if not included.

You can pass in any hash of query attributes you wish as per the
[Harvest API](http://www.getharvest.com/api) page.

You can find more examples in `/examples` and in the documentation for Harvest::Base

## Hardy Client

The guys at Harvest built a great API, but there are always dangers in writing code that depends on an API. For example, HTTP Timeouts, Occasional Bad Gateways, and Rate Limiting issues need to be accounted for.

Using `Harvested#client` your code needs to handle all these situations. However you can also use `Harvested#hardy_client` which will retry errors and wait for Rate Limit resets.

```ruby
harvest = Harvest.hardy_client('yoursubdomain', 'yourusername', 'yourpassword')
harvest.projects() # This will wait for the Rate Limit reset if you have gone over your limit
```

## Ruby support

Harvested's tests are currently passing for 1.8.7, 1.9.2, JRuby 1.6.2, and Rubinius

## How to Contribute

If you find what looks like a bug:

1. Check the GitHub issue tracker to see if anyone else has had the same issue.
http://github.com/zmoazeni/harvested/issues/
2. If you donâ€™t see anything, create an issue with information on how to reproduce it.

If you want to contribute an enhancement or a fix:

1. Fork the project on github http://github.com/zmoazeni/harvested
2. Make your changes with tests
3. Commit the changes without messing with the Rakefile, VERSION, or history
4. Send me a pull request

Note on running tests: most specs run against a live Harvest account. To run the suite, sign up for a free trial account and fill out `/spec/support/harvest_credentials.yml` *(a sample harvest_credentials.example.yml has been included)*.

**DO NOT USE YOUR NORMAL CREDENTIALS IN `/spec/support/harvest_credentials.yml`!!!** The test suite blasts all the data before running (similiar to DatabaseCleaner).

The tests use [VCR](https://github.com/myronmarston/vcr) to cache the test responses. This is a great boon for running the tests offline. While uncommon, sometimes the Harvest API will send an erroneous response and VCR will cache it, then subsequent runs will use the incorrect cached response. In order to ignore VCR you can run the specs by passing CACHE=false (e.g. `CACHE=false bundle rake spec`).

Using [rvm](https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/) you can run the tests against the popular ruby runtimes by running:

  ./spec/test_rubies

Each runtime needs to be installed in rvm along with the bundler gem.

## TODO

* Write Documentation
* Allow Timer Toggling

## Notes on Harvest Estimates

Estimates aren't currently supported due to lack of an API. If this opens up, harvested will include them.
