    # == Options
    # * +:ssl+ - Whether or not to use SSL when connecting to Harvest. This is dependent on whether your account supports it. Set to +true+ by default
    # * +:retry+ - How many times the hardy client should retry errors. Set to +5+ by default.

    # == Examples
    #   Harvest.hardy_client('mysubdomain', 'myusername', 'mypassword', :ssl => true, :retry => 3)

    # == Errors
    # The hardy client will retry the following errors

    # * Net::HTTPFatalError
    # * Errno::ECONNRESET
